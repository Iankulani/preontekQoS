# preontekQoS
Preontek QoS is a python and Rust-based Quality of Service (QoS) tool designed to reduce jitter, latency, and buffer bloat in real ISP networks. It uses CAKE and FQ-CoDel for smart traffic shaping, with a modern GUI and CLI for real-time monitoring, shaping, and bandwidth fairness across users.
